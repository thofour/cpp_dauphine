/*
 * Exercise 1
 *
 * Write a linear interpolation function that takes 3 input vectors:
 *
 * - x: the abscissa
 * - y: the ordinates
 * - x_interp: the abscissa of the wanted values
 *
 * and an output vector res, holding the ordinates of the interpolated points.
 *
 * That is, for each abscissa a in x_interp such that x1 < a < x2, res holds a value
 * v_res such that (a, v_res) is the linear interpolation of (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
 */

/*
 * Exercise 2
 *
 * Given a std::vector<int> holding values between 0 and 9,
 * count the numbers of pairs with sum equal to 9.
 *
 * For instance, if the input vector is { 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9 },
 * the result is 5: (0, 9), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 6), (4, 5).
 *
 * A number can be consumed only once to form such a pair.
 *
 * We assume the input vector is sorted.

/*
 * Exercise 3
 *
 * Given a std::vector<int> holding values between 0 and 9, and an integer n,
 * count the numbers of pairs with sum equal to 9 that hold n as their first value
 *
 * For instance, if the input vector is { 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9 } and n = 3,
 * the result is 2:
 *
 * A number can be consumed only once to form such a pair.

 * We assume the input vector is sorted.
